## Personal page

## Who am I?
I am 26, proudly from [Poggi](https://goo.gl/maps/w37kgkhxZfR2) > Imperia > Italy. I like stats, rugby, food and political stuff, so you will find here probably something related to all of this.

## Where am I right now?
I am currently in Milan, working as a Data Science Analyst at Doxa, one of the biggest marker research company in Italy.

## What the hell is this website?
It is definitely a first attempt: I will load some random analysis and visualization for pure experimentation purposes.
